Goal of Eclipse Modelling Framework is to generate code from EMF models.The code is auto-generated from Ecore diagram. 
The EMF will then generate xmi file using the generated code which will represent the Java classes from the model.

1. I have done various modeling for a specific application - Blood Bank System

--> Activity Diagrams
--> Class (Ecore) Diagram
--> Usecase Diagram
   
2. Also, I have used the ecore model to generate the xmi instance for the Java classes in the ecore diagram.

Knowledge Gained:
 1. Understanding of code genertaion using EMF Modeling and the usecases,
 2. Understanding business perspective and representing them in various models.
 3. Hands-on for one code-generation tool which will help generate code.
